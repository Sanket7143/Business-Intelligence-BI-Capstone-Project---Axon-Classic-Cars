Project Title: Business Intelligence (BI) Capstone Project - Axon Classic Cars

Objective:Our goal is to empower Axon, a classic car retailer, with data-driven insights using PowerBI. By analyzing sales data comprehensively, we aim to enhance decision-making processes and drive sales growth.

Brief Description:We began by installing a MySQL database to store sales data securely. Connecting PowerBI to the database allowed seamless integration and analysis of sales data. Through meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing, we ensured the accuracy and reliability of our insights. Utilizing PowerBI's DAX functions, we computed key metrics such as sales, profit, and profit margin. Analysis of sales trends by product line, month, and country provided actionable insights for strategic decision-making. Our recommendations focused on optimizing sales tactics based on profit margins and monthly sales trends. Finally, we established a centralized system for real-time sales reporting, empowering Axon with timely information for informed decision-making.

Conclusion:By delivering data-driven insights and optimizing sales strategies, our project has significantly enhanced Axon's sales performance. The centralized system and actionable recommendations have empowered Axon to make informed decisions, resulting in improved sales outcomes and strengthened competitiveness in the classic car retail market.
